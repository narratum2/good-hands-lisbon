### Phase 3: Booking Flow → Request System
**Impact**: CRITICAL - Business model change
**Time**: ~3-4 hours

2. Choose date/time
3. Fill details
4. **Pay** → **Confirm**

New flow:
1. Select service
2. Preferred date/time *(not guaranteed)*
3. Fill details
4. **Submit Request**
5. **Await Confirmation** (no payment upfront)

##### C. Booking API (`app/api/bookings/route.ts`):

## 🛠️ TECHNICAL DEBT IDENTIFIED

1. **Star Ratings**: Currently using emoji stars (`⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐`)
   - Need to create `<StarRating rating={5} />` component
   - Replace all instances (weddings, retreats, partnerships pages)

2. **Inconsistent Icon Usage**: Some pages still use Lucide icons while we have custom icons
   - Recommendation: Standardize on CustomIcons throughout

3. **Payment Processing**: Currently integrated with Stripe
   - If moving to request-first model, Stripe should be **post-confirmation** only
   - May need to add "Pay Now" link sent via email after confirmation

4. **Notion Integration**: Status field needs updating
   - Current: `Status: 'Confirmed'`
   - New: `Status: 'Pending Request'`
   - Add new status: `Status: 'Confirmed'` (after manual approval)

## 📈 BUSINESS IMPACT ANALYSIS

### Booking → Request System:

**Pros**:
- ✅ Better reflects concierge service model
- ✅ Reduces abandoned carts (no upfront payment)
- ✅ Allows price negotiation/customization
- ✅ Filters serious inquiries
- ✅ Builds trust ("we'll find the right match for you")

**Cons**:
- ❌ Extra step in conversion funnel
- ❌ Requires manual confirmation (labor cost)
- ❌ Users may go elsewhere if they want instant booking

**Recommendation**:
- Implement request system as primary
- Add "Instant Book" option for select premium services (higher price)
- A/B test both flows to measure conversion

### On-Site vs Studio Pricing:

**Pros**:
- ✅ Clearly communicates premium value
- ✅ Captures high-margin hotel/apartment services
- ✅ Differentiates from competitors

**Cons**:
- ❌ May discourage price-sensitive customers
- ❌ Requires clear communication of value

**Recommendation**:
- Lead with studio pricing (lower barrier)
- Prominently feature on-site as "premium convenience"
- Show what's included (travel, setup, premium products)
