            You hired a photographer. You found the perfect location—dramatic cliffs at Cabo da Roca, golden beaches in Cascais, fairy-tale gardens in Sintra. Now you need to look incredible on camera.
          </p>

          <h2>Why Regular Makeup Doesn't Work</h2>
          <p>
            Camera lighting is different from real life. What looks natural in person disappears on camera. Wind ruins hair in minutes. Humidity melts makeup. Salt air makes everything frizzy.
          </p>

          <p>Professional photoshoot styling solves this. The products are different. The techniques are different. And someone stays with you to fix things as you shoot.</p>

          <h2>What Makes Photoshoot Styling Different</h2>
          
          <h3>Camera-ready makeup</h3>
          <p>
            Professional makeup artists use techniques that photograph well. More definition than you'd wear day-to-day. Matte where you need it, strategic glow where light hits. No flashback from powder. No shine ruining shots.
          </p>

          <h3>Wind-proof hair</h3>
          <p>
            Coastal styling means products that can handle wind. Texturizing sprays, flexible-hold products, strategic pinning. Your hair needs to move naturally but stay in place. Coastal pros know how to balance this.
          </p>

          <h3>Touch-ups between locations</h3>
          <p>
            Most coastal shoots involve multiple spots. Sunset at Cabo da Roca, golden hour in Cascais, morning light at Guincho Beach. A professional stays with you to refresh makeup and fix hair between locations.
          </p>

          <h2>Best Coastal Locations for Photoshoots</h2>

          <h3>Cabo da Roca</h3>
          <p>
            The westernmost point of continental Europe. Dramatic cliffs, crashing waves, endless sky. Insanely windy—your hair will move constantly. Plan for flexible, textured styling.
          </p>

          <h3>Cascais Coastline</h3>
          <p>
            Golden beaches, rocky coves, charming boardwalks. More sheltered than Cabo da Roca. Still coastal wind, but manageable. Perfect for softer, more romantic looks.
          </p>

          <h3>Sintra (Quinta da Regaleira, Pena Palace)</h3>
          <p>
            Not technically coastal, but close enough to combine with beach shoots. Fairy-tale gardens, mystical architecture. More humidity than wind. Hair needs anti-frizz protection.
          </p>

          <h3>Guincho Beach</h3>
          <p>
            Wild, windswept, dramatic. Popular with surfers and photographers. Extremely windy—embrace it. Go for beachy, textured looks rather than polished perfection.
          </p>

          <h2>Timing Your Shoot</h2>

          <h3>Golden Hour (Sunrise/Sunset)</h3>
          <p>
            The hour after sunrise and before sunset. Soft, warm light that makes everyone look amazing. Book 2-3 hours for hair and makeup before sunrise shoots. For sunset, start mid-afternoon.
          </p>

          <h3>Overcast Days</h3>
          <p>
            Many photographers prefer clouds—the light is soft and flattering. No harsh shadows. Makeup can be slightly less intense since there's no direct sun to wash things out.
          </p>

          <h2>What to Tell Your Stylist</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Where you're shooting (they'll adjust for wind/humidity)</li>
            <li>What time of day (affects makeup intensity)</li>
            <li>Your outfit colors (makeup complements wardrobe)</li>
            <li>The photo vibe (editorial, romantic, dramatic, natural)</li>
            <li>How long the shoot will last (more touchups = more time)</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Pricing for Photoshoot Beauty</h2>
          <p>
            Professional photoshoot styling in Lisbon typically ranges from <strong>€150-€400</strong> depending on:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Duration:</strong> 2-hour shoots vs. all-day sessions</li>
            <li><strong>Complexity:</strong> Natural looks vs. editorial makeup</li>
            <li><strong>Travel:</strong> Cascais and Sintra may include travel fees</li>
            <li><strong>Touch-ups:</strong> Staying for the entire shoot costs more</li>
          </ul>
