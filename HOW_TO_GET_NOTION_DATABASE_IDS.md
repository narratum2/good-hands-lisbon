# 🔍 How to Get Your Notion Database IDs

**Quick Guide** - Takes 2 minutes!

---

## 📋 What You Need

You need **2 Database IDs**:
1. **Bookings Database ID** - Where customer bookings are stored
2. **Chat Database ID** - Where chat messages are stored

---

## 🎯 Step-by-Step Instructions

### Method 1: From the URL (Easiest)

1. **Open your Bookings database in Notion**
   - The one Notion AI created or you created

2. **Look at the URL in your browser**:
   ```
   https://www.notion.so/yourworkspace/DATABASE_ID?v=...
                                      ↑ Copy this part
   ```

3. **The Database ID is the long string** between your workspace name and `?v=`
   - It looks like: `a1b2c3d4e5f67890a1b2c3d4e5f67890`
   - It's 32 characters long (letters and numbers)

4. **Copy it!**

5. **Repeat for Chat database**

---

## 📝 Example

If your URL is:
```
https://www.notion.so/myworkspace/a1b2c3d4e5f67890a1b2c3d4e5f67890?v=abc123
```

Your Database ID is: `a1b2c3d4e5f67890a1b2c3d4e5f67890`

---

## 🔗 Method 2: Share Link Method

1. **Open database in Notion**
2. **Click "Share" button** (top right)
3. **Click "Copy link"**
4. **Paste the link** - it contains the database ID
5. **Extract the ID** from the URL (same as Method 1)

---

## ✅ Once You Have Both IDs

Just paste them here in this format:

```
BOOKINGS: a1b2c3d4e5f67890a1b2c3d4e5f67890
CHAT: x1y2z3a4b5c6d7e8f9g0h1i2j3k4l5m6
```

And I'll:
1. Add them to Vercel for you
2. Redeploy the site
3. Test that bookings save to Notion
4. Test that chat saves to Notion
5. Confirm everything works!

## 🤔 Where Are My Databases?

If Notion AI already created them, look for:

**Bookings Database** might be named:
- "Good Hands Bookings"
- "Customer Bookings"
- "Appointments"
- "Reservations"

**Chat Database** might be named:
- "Good Hands Chat"
- "Messages"
- "Customer Messages"
- "Chat Logs"

## 🆘 Can't Find Them?

Tell me:
1. What did Notion AI create?
2. What databases do you see in your workspace?

And I can help you identify the right ones or create new ones if needed!
