## ü§ñ AI PROMPT FOR NOTION SETUP

**Copy and paste this into Claude/ChatGPT on Notion.so:**

```
I'm setting up Notion for my beauty concierge service "Good Hands" booking management system.

TASK 1: Create 3 databases with these exact specifications:

- Name (title)
- Email (email) 
- Phone (phone)
- Service (select: Hair Styling, Nail Care, Skincare, Makeup, Wellness, Wedding Package)
- Booking Date (date)
- Time Slot (select: 09:00, 10:00, 11:00, 12:00, 13:00, 14:00, 15:00, 16:00, 17:00, 18:00)
- Neighborhood (select: Chiado, Pr√≠ncipe Real, Baixa, Alfama, Bel√©m, Cascais, Sintra, Avenida)
- Status (select: New, Confirmed, In Progress, Completed, Cancelled)
- Booking Reference (text) - format: GH-XXXXXX
- Customer Message (text)
- Created At (created time)

- UTM Medium (text)
- UTM Campaign (text)

DATABASE 2: "Good Hands - Customers"

TASK 2: After creating databases:
1. Give me the database IDs (from the URLs when you open each database as a full page)
2. Show me how to connect them to my integration named "Good Hands"
3. Create a sample booking entry to test the setup

Format database IDs like:
Bookings DB ID: 1234567890abcdef...
Customers DB ID: 0987654321fedcba...
Professionals DB ID: abcdef1234567890...
```

## üéØ WHAT HAPPENS AFTER SETUP

### Automatic Workflow:
1. User completes booking on website
2. **API creates entry in Notion Bookings database**
3. **Email sent to user** (when email service configured)
4. **Admin gets notification** in Notion
5. **Booking appears in dashboard** for matching

### Manual Workflow (Until Automation):
1. Check Notion Bookings database daily
2. Assign professional to booking
3. Email customer with details
4. Update status to "Confirmed"
5. Follow up after service
