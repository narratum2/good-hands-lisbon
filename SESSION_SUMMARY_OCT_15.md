## Key Decisions Made

### Design Philosophy
- **Conversational over presentational** - Talk to users, don't lecture
- **Visual over textual** - Show, don't tell
- **Simple over complex** - One message per section
- **Trust through simplicity** - Professional yet approachable

### Technical Choices
- Use Lucide icons (no emojis)
- Full-page booking flow (no modal)
- Minimal parallax (performance)
- Direct links for maps (if embed fails)

### Content Strategy
- Remove duplicates ruthlessly
- Focus on user benefits, not features
- Use authentic imagery (plan photoshoot)
- Keep text concise and scannable
