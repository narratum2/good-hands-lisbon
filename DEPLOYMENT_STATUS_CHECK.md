# 🔍 Deployment Status Check

## ✅ Code Status
- **Local Files**: ✅ All changes committed and pushed
- **Git Status**: ✅ Latest commit: `b35922b - Hyper AI Agent Ready`
- **Build Status**: ✅ Local build passes (89 pages compiled)

## 🌐 Live Site Status (Checked via HTTP)

| Page | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Homepage (`/`) | ✅ 301 | Site accessible (redirect) |
| `/makeup-knowledge-base` | ❌ 404 | **NOT DEPLOYED YET** |
| `/services/makeup` | ✅ 301 | Page exists (redirect) |

## 🔍 Findings

### ✅ Working:
1. Site is accessible
2. Existing pages load correctly
3. Code is pushed to GitHub

### ⚠️ Issue:
- **New `/makeup-knowledge-base` page returns 404**
- This suggests Vercel deployment may not have completed yet OR there was a build error

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Option 1: Wait for Deployment (2-5 minutes)
Vercel auto-deploys on push. If you just pushed, wait a few minutes and check again:
```bash
curl -I https://goodhands.com/makeup-knowledge-base
```

### Option 2: Check Vercel Dashboard
1. Go to https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Select "good-hands" project
3. Check "Deployments" tab
4. Look for latest deployment status
5. Check build logs for errors

### Option 3: Manual Deployment Trigger
If auto-deploy didn't work:
1. Vercel Dashboard → Deployments
2. Click "Redeploy" on latest deployment
3. OR make a small commit to trigger new build

## 🔧 Potential Issues

1. **Build Error**: Check Vercel build logs for TypeScript/compile errors
2. **Route Not Recognized**: Verify Next.js recognizes the route structure
3. **Deployment Delay**: Vercel deployments can take 2-5 minutes

## ✅ Verification Checklist

After deployment completes:
- [ ] `/makeup-knowledge-base` returns 200 OK
- [ ] Page content loads correctly
- [ ] Schema markup present in page source
- [ ] Links work correctly
- [ ] Mobile responsive

## 📝 Browser Check Commands

```bash
# Check page status
curl -I https://goodhands.com/makeup-knowledge-base

# Check if page has content
curl -s https://goodhands.com/makeup-knowledge-base | grep -i "Makeup Knowledge Base"

# Check for schema markup
curl -s https://goodhands.com/makeup-knowledge-base | grep -i "application/ld+json"
```
