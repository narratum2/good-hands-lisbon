## üéØ WHY ISSUES OCCURRED & HOW FIXED

### Root Causes Identified
1. **Vercel Edge Cache** - Serves cached version globally
2. **Next.js Build Cache** - `.next` folder cached old builds
3. **Git Commit Timing** - Some changes not in same commit
4. **CDN Propagation** - Takes time to reach all edge locations

### Solutions Applied
1. ‚úÖ **Clear build cache** - `rm -rf .next`
2. ‚úÖ **Force fresh build** - New webpack chunks generated
3. ‚úÖ **New git commit** - Triggers fresh Vercel deployment
4. ‚úÖ **Wait for propagation** - Allow 5-15 minutes

### Prevention Strategy
- **Always clear .next before major deployments**
- **Verify changes locally first** (`npm run dev`)
- **Use cache-busting techniques** when needed
- **Test with hard refresh** after deployment
