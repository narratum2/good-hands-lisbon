## 📋 IMPLEMENTATION PLAN

### Phase 1: Background Refinement (Critical)

**Current Homepage Flow**:
```
Hero (dark overlay on image) ✅ Keep
Trust Signals (white) ✅ Keep
Value Prop (white) → Change to off-white
Search (white) ✅ Keep
Services (off-white) ✅ Keep
Categories (white) ✅ Keep
Testimonials (off-white) ✅ Keep
CTA (black) → Change to gold/10 background
```

**New Flow (Editorial)**:
```
Hero (subtle dark overlay) - Lighter
Trust Signals (white)
Value Prop (off-white) - Subtle
Search (white)
Services (off-white)
Categories (white)
Testimonials (off-white)
CTA (gold/5 background) - Elegant, not heavy
```

---

### Phase 2: Typography Refinement

**Headline Consistency**:
```css
H1 (Hero): 80px → 72px (less overwhelming)
H2 (Sections): 56px → 48px (more readable)
H3 (Cards): 32px → 28px (better balance)
Body: 17px → 18px (more comfortable)
```

**Weight Adjustments**:
```css
Headlines: font-light (300) - Elegant
Subheadings: font-normal (400) - Readable
Body: font-light (300) - Editorial
Captions: font-medium (500) - Clarity
```

---

### Phase 3: Spacing Harmony

**Vertical Rhythm**:
```css
Section padding: 160px → 120px (less heavy)
Between elements: 48px → 40px (tighter)
Paragraph spacing: 24px → 20px (better flow)
Card gaps: 48px → 32px (more cohesive)
```

**Container Widths**:
```css
Max-width: 1280px → 1200px (more focused)
Content: 896px → 800px (optimal reading)
Narrow: 640px → 600px (comfortable)
```

---

### Phase 4: Color Palette Refinement

**Current**:
```css
--black: #0a0a0a (too dark)
--off-white: #fafaf8 (good)
--gold: #b8985f (good)
--gray-dark: #2d2d2d (too dark for body)
```

**Editorial (Lighter)**:
```css
--black: #1a1a1a (softer black)
--off-white: #fafaf8 (keep)
--gold: #b8985f (keep)
--gray-dark: #4a4a4a (lighter for body text)
--gray-light: #f5f5f3 (warmer light gray)
```

**Better**: Lighter overlay (50% opacity)  
**Result**: More inviting, less heavy

**Current**: Black background
