## 🔴 WHAT ONLY YOU CAN FIX (1 Action)

### **The ONLY Issue: Notion Database Permissions**

**Problem**: Databases are not shared with your Notion integration.

**Why I can't fix it**: Only you have access to your Notion workspace settings.

**How to fix it** (2 minutes):

### Step-by-Step Fix:

#### 1. Open BOOKINGS Database
Go to: https://www.notion.so/e50edfbee2e34df8b4566edc8bdc1189

#### 2. Share with Integration
- Click the **"..."** (three dots) in the top right corner
- Click **"Connections"** or **"Add connections"**
- Look for **"Good Hands"** integration
- If it's not there, click **"Add connections"**
- Select your **"Good Hands"** integration
- Click **"Confirm"**

#### 3. Repeat for CUSTOMERS Database
Go to: https://www.notion.so/e06a065f262147738e47005090b94e02

Repeat the same steps:
- Click **"..."**
- Click **"Connections"**
- Add **"Good Hands"** integration

#### 4. Test
Go to: https://good-hands-seven.vercel.app/book

Submit a test booking:
- Name: Test User
- Email: test@test.com
- Phone: +351912345678
- Service: Hair Styling
- Date: Tomorrow
- Time: 14:00

#### 5. Verify
Check your BOOKINGS database in Notion - you should see the entry!

## 🎯 WHY THIS IS THE ISSUE

### Evidence:
1. ✅ `/api/test-notion` returns success → API key works
2. ✅ Database IDs are correct → Can read database info
3. ✅ All properties exist → Schema is perfect
4. ❌ Bookings don't save → **Can't write to database**

### Conclusion:
The integration can **read** database metadata but can't **write** pages.

This is a classic **permissions issue** in Notion.

**Fix**: Share databases with integration (gives write permission).

## 🎯 ALTERNATIVE: Get Error Logs (If Sharing Doesn't Work)

If sharing databases doesn't fix it (unlikely), here's how to get the actual error:

### 1. Go to Vercel
👉 https://vercel.com/narratums-projects/good-hands/deployments

### 2. Click Latest Deployment

### 3. Click "Runtime Logs" Tab

### 4. Submit Test Booking
Go to: https://good-hands-seven.vercel.app/book

### 5. Watch Logs
Look for:
```
❌ Error creating booking record in Notion: {
  "message": "...",
  "code": "...",
  ...
}
```

### 6. Send Me the Error
Copy the entire error message and send it to me.

I'll tell you exactly what to fix.
