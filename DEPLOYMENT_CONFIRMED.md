3. Select: ✅ Production, ✅ Preview, ✅ Development
4. Click **Save**
5. **Redeploy** after adding (or it will apply to next deployment)

## 🔍 Verification Steps

### 1. Check Deployment Status
```bash
# Visit Vercel dashboard
https://vercel.com/narratum2/good-hands/deployments
```

### 2. Test New Pages
```bash
# Should return 200 (after deployment completes)
curl -I https://goodhands.com/makeup-knowledge-base
curl -I https://goodhands.com/services/makeup
```

### 3. Test GA4 Integration
Open browser console on your site:
```javascript
// Should see:
✅ GA4 initialized with ID: G-ZGDMVGP040
✅ Enhanced Measurement: Enabled
✅ Traffic Source Detection: Active
```

### 4. Verify Schema Markup
Visit pages and check page source:
- Look for `<script type="application/ld+json">`
- Verify multiple schema types present

---

## 📊 Expected Build Output

- **Total Routes**: 89 pages
- **Build Time**: ~2-5 minutes
- **Build Status**: ✅ Should succeed (all tests passed locally)

---

## 🚨 If Deployment Fails

1. **Check Vercel Build Logs**
   - Go to deployment → View build logs
   - Look for TypeScript errors
   - Check for missing dependencies

2. **Common Issues**:
   - Environment variables missing (add `NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID`)
   - Build timeout (increase in Vercel settings if needed)
   - Memory issues (optimize if needed)

3. **Rollback**:
   - Go to Deployments
   - Find previous working deployment
   - Click "Promote to Production"
