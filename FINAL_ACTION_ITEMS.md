## ⚠️ PENDING ITEMS (2/47 = 4%)

### 1. Complete Notion Integration (HIGH PRIORITY)

**Status**: ⚠️ **80% Complete**

**What's Done**:
- ✅ Notion API key added to Vercel
- ✅ API endpoints created (`/api/chat`, `/api/bookings`)
- ✅ Integration code written
- ✅ Error handling implemented

**What's Missing**:
- ⚠️ **Booking Database ID** - Need from user
- ⚠️ **Chat Database ID** - Need from user
- ⚠️ **Redeploy after adding IDs**

**How to Complete**:
1. User needs to provide 2 database IDs from Notion
2. Add them to Vercel environment variables:
   ```
   NOTION_BOOKING_DATABASE_ID=xxxxx
   NOTION_CHAT_DATABASE_ID=xxxxx
   ```
3. Redeploy in Vercel
4. Test booking submission → should appear in Notion
5. Test chat message → should appear in Notion

**Impact if Not Done**:
- Bookings work but don't save to Notion
- Chat works but messages don't save to Notion
- User has to manually track customers

**Priority**: HIGH (business-critical for CRM)

---

### 2. Browserbase AI Integration (LOW PRIORITY)

**Status**: ⚠️ **Attempted but API Key Issue**

**What Happened**:
- User provided Browserbase API key: `bb_live_YF7ijMg-qyLRZxuO1D5cu0ZYhqI`
- Set in environment
- Created browser session successfully
- But AI features (observe, extract, act) not working
- Error: "API key not valid"

**Possible Issues**:
- May need Stagehand API key (separate from Browserbase)
- Key might need to be configured differently
- Service might have different authentication

**What This Enables**:
- AI-powered visual testing
- Automated interaction with live site
- Better QA automation
- Screenshot capture

**Impact if Not Done**:
- No impact on site functionality
- Manual testing still works fine
- Nice-to-have feature only

**Priority**: LOW (optional enhancement)

**Recommendation**: Skip for now, focus on Notion integration

## 🎯 IMMEDIATE ACTION PLAN

### For User (YOU):

**Action 1: Get Notion Database IDs** (2 minutes)
1. Open your Notion workspace
2. Find the databases Notion AI created:
   - Bookings database
   - Chat database
3. For each database:
   - Open it in Notion
   - Look at URL: `https://notion.so/workspace/DATABASE_ID?v=...`
   - Copy the DATABASE_ID part
4. Paste both IDs here in chat

**Format**:
```
BOOKINGS: a1b2c3d4e5f6...
CHAT: x1y2z3a4b5c6...
```

---

### For AI Assistant (ME):

Once I receive the database IDs, I will:

**Step 1: Add to Vercel** (1 minute)
```bash
# Will run via Vercel CLI or guide you through dashboard
vercel env add NOTION_BOOKING_DATABASE_ID
vercel env add NOTION_CHAT_DATABASE_ID
```

**Step 2: Verify Environment** (1 minute)
```bash
# Check all Notion vars are set
vercel env ls
```

**Step 3: Trigger Redeploy** (2 minutes)
```bash
# Redeploy to apply new env vars
vercel --prod
```

**Step 4: Test Integration** (5 minutes)
```bash
# Test booking submission
curl -X POST https://good-hands-seven.vercel.app/api/bookings \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"service":"hair","date":"2025-11-01","time":"10:00",...}'

# Should return: "notion": true
```

**Step 5: Verify in Notion** (2 minutes)
- Check Bookings database for test entry
- Check Chat database for test message
- Confirm both working

**Step 6: Final Documentation** (5 minutes)
- Update all status docs
- Mark Notion integration as complete
- Create final handoff guide
