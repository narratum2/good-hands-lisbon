## üîç What to Check in Vercel Dashboard

If you're seeing a "deployment failure" message, check:

### 1. **Build Logs**
- Go to: https://vercel.com/dashboard
- Click on your project
- Click on "Deployments"
- Look for the latest deployment
- Check if build succeeded or failed

### 2. **Common Issues**

**TypeScript Errors**
- The build might have warnings but still succeed
- Check if there are any blocking type errors

**Missing Dependencies**
- Ensure `gray-matter` is in package.json ‚úÖ
- All other dependencies should be installed

**Environment Variables**
- Notion API key (optional, won't break site)
- Supabase keys (for booking form)
- Intercom ID (optional)

### 3. **Runtime vs Build Errors**

**Build Errors** = Deployment fails completely
- Site won't deploy at all
- You'll see red "Failed" status
- Build logs will show the error

**Runtime Errors** = Site deploys but has issues
- Site loads but some features don't work
- Check browser console for errors
- Check Vercel function logs

---

## üéØ Current Status

Based on my testing:
- ‚úÖ Site is **DEPLOYED**
- ‚úÖ Site is **ACCESSIBLE**
- ‚úÖ Site is **RENDERING**
- ‚úÖ All core components loading

**The deployment appears to be SUCCESSFUL.**

## üìä What Might Be "Failing"

If you're seeing an error, it could be:

### 1. **Previous Deployment Failed**
- But the current one (commit `10cd2a8`) is working
- Check if you're looking at an old deployment

### 2. **Function Errors**
- API routes might have errors
- Check `/api/bookings` endpoint
- Check `/api/chat` endpoint

### 3. **Client-Side Errors**
- OptimizationProvider might have initialization errors
- Check browser console on the live site

### 4. **Warnings Mistaken for Errors**
- Build warnings don't prevent deployment
- TypeScript warnings are non-blocking

---

## üîß How to Diagnose

### Step 1: Check Vercel Dashboard
```
1. Go to vercel.com/dashboard
2. Find "good-hands-lisbon" project
3. Click "Deployments"
4. Check latest deployment status
```

### Step 2: Check Browser Console
```
1. Visit https://good-hands-seven.vercel.app
2. Open DevTools (F12)
3. Check Console tab for errors
4. Look for OptimizationProvider logs
```

### Step 3: Check Specific Pages
```
- Homepage: https://good-hands-seven.vercel.app

- Book: https://good-hands-seven.vercel.app/book
- Services: https://good-hands-seven.vercel.app/services
```

## üö® If Truly Failing

If the deployment is genuinely failing, the most likely causes are:

1. **TypeScript compilation errors** (we fixed most of these)
2. **Missing exports** in optimization files
3. **Import errors** in OptimizationProvider
4. **Build timeout** (unlikely for this size project)

---

## ‚úÖ Recommended Actions

1. **Visit the live site** and check if it works
2. **Check Vercel dashboard** for actual error messages
3. **Share the specific error** you're seeing
4. **Check browser console** for runtime errors

**Current evidence suggests the site IS deployed and working.**
