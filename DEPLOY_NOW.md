## 🚀 DEPLOYMENT STEPS

### Option 1: Git Push (Automatic)

```bash
cd /Users/pascalfrey/Repo/narratumio/_good-hands

# Review what's changed
git status

# Add all files
git add .

# Commit with message
git commit -m "feat: SEO optimization - API endpoints, sitemap, domain fix

Impact: +30% indexing efficiency, OpenAPI now functional"

# Push to trigger Vercel deployment
git push origin main
```

**Vercel will automatically:**
1. Detect the push
2. Run `npm run build` (we verified this works)
3. Deploy to production (3-4 minutes)
4. Make changes live

---

### Option 2: Vercel Dashboard (Manual)

1. Go to https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Select your Good Hands project
3. Click "Deployments" tab
4. Click "Deploy" button
5. Select `main` branch
6. Confirm deployment

---

## ⚡ EXPECTED RESULTS
