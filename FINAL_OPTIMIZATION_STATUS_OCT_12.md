## Design Hotels Principles Applied

### 1. Trust the Reader's Intelligence
Don't over-explain. Short sentences. White space.

**Before:** "There's something uniquely romantic about sharing a wellness experience with your partner. Whether celebrating an anniversary, escaping busy routines, or simply reconnecting..."

**After:** "Sharing a spa day with your partner is different from going solo. More intimate. More romantic."

### 2. Specific Over Generic
Real names, real prices, real details.

**Before:** "Trendy neighborhoods"
**After:** "Príncipe Real, Cais do Sodré, Santos"

**Before:** "Affordable pricing"
**After:** "€60-150 for cuts, €120-300 for color"

### 3. Show Don't Tell
Demonstrate expertise through details, not claims.

**Before:** "We provide comprehensive beauty solutions"
**After:** "Wind ruins hair. We use products that hold."

### 4. Conversational But Polished
Write like you talk, but edited.

**Before:** "It is essential to maintain proper skincare protocols"
**After:** "Your skin needs attention in Lisbon's climate"

### 5. Honest Language
Build trust through authenticity.

**Before:** "Suboptimal outcomes may occasionally occur"
**After:** "Bad haircut happens. We fix it."
