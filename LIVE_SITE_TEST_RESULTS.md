## ⚠️ **WHAT NEEDS ATTENTION**:

### **Notion Database Integration**
Status: **Environment variables not connecting**

**Issue**: Database IDs not being recognized even though added to Vercel

**Current Status**:
```
✅ API Key: Connected
⚠️ Booking DB: Not detected
⚠️ Chat DB: Not detected
```

**Why This Happens**:
This is a common Vercel issue where environment variables need specific configuration:
1. Must be set for "Production" environment
2. Deployment must complete after adding vars
3. Variables must not have typos or extra spaces

**Impact**:
- Site works perfectly (development mode)
- Bookings are captured (not saved to Notion yet)
- All user-facing features functional
- Data safe in development fallback

**Solution Needed**:
Need to verify in Vercel dashboard that:
- `NOTION_BOOKING_DATABASE_ID` = `e50edfbee2e34df8b4566edc8bdc1189`
- `NOTION_CHAT_DATABASE_ID` = `51c3d3aae9fc4d01bc85c3f90d99c0a8`
- Both have "Production" checkbox ✅
- Latest deployment is "Ready" (not "Building")
