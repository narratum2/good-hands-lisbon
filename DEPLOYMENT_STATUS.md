## ⚠️ NOTE ABOUT YUCATAN POST

**URL Requested**: `/journal/yucatan-wellness-beauty`  
**Status**: ❌ Does not exist

This post is **not in your blog directory**. Your blog is focused on **Lisbon** beauty services, not Yucatan/Mexico.

**Available posts are all Lisbon-focused**:
- Lisbon neighborhoods
- Lisbon salons
- Lisbon spas
- Lisbon wedding beauty
- Lisbon grooming
- etc.

If you want a Yucatan post, we'd need to create it.
