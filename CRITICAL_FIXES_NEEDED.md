# Critical Fixes Needed - Immediate Action Required

## Priority 1: Remove Duplicates & Redundancy

### Duplicate Social Media Sections
**Issue:** Social media icons appear multiple times on same pages
**Location:** About page, various other pages
**Fix:** Keep ONE social section per page (preferably in footer)

### Duplicate "Follow Our Journey" / "Connect With Us"
**Issue:** Same content, different headings
**Fix:** Consolidate to one section with better design

---

## Priority 2: Design Issues

### Text Readability on Images
**Issue:** Black text on dark images (unreadable)
**Fix Required:**
- Add 80% dark overlay to ALL image backgrounds with text
- Use white text with drop shadow
- Ensure 7:1 contrast ratio

### Repetitive/Generic Images  
**Issue:** Same spa product photos, no location-specific imagery
**Fix Required:**
- Source actual Lisbon neighborhood photos
- Replace generic stock with action shots
- Show real professionals working

### Boxy, Non-Engaging Layouts
**Issue:** Everything is cards/boxes, feels static
**Fix Required:**
- Remove box-based problem/solution grids
- Add Apple-style scroll effects
- Make content flow naturally

## Priority 3: Functional Issues

### Interactive Maps Not Working
**Issue:** Google Maps embed may have API key issues
**Fix Options:**
1. Verify API key is valid and has Embed API enabled
2. Use alternative: Link to Google Maps directly (simpler)
3. Create custom map with Mapbox

### Ugly Booking Popup
**Status:** ✅ FIXED - Created beautiful `/book` page
**Action:** Remove old modal, update all "Book Now" buttons to link to `/book`

### Button Inconsistency
**Issue:** Different button styles across pages
**Fix:** Use only `btn-gold` (primary) and `btn-secondary` (secondary)

---

## Priority 4: Content Issues

### About Page - Not Engaging
**Fix Required:**
- Add scroll-triggered animations (Apple-style)
- Create visual timeline of company story
- Add team photos (when available)
- Interactive mission/values section
- Remove duplicate sections

### Footer - Too Heavy
**Issue:** Too many links, overwhelming
**Fix:** Simplify to essential links only:
- Services | About | Contact | Blog
- Social media (3 icons max)
