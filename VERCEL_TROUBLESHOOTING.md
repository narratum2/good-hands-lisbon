## Common Vercel Errors & Solutions

### Error 1: "Module not found: Can't resolve 'encoding'"

**Error Message**:
```
Module not found: Can't resolve 'encoding'
```

**Cause**: `@notionhq/client` optional dependency warning

**Solution**: This is just a warning, not a blocker. Add to `package.json`:
```json
{
  "optionalDependencies": {
    "encoding": "^0.1.13"
  }
}
```

### Error 2: "NOTION_API_KEY is not configured"

**Error Message** (in function logs):
```

```

**Cause**: Environment variables not set in Vercel

2. Add: `NOTION_API_KEY` with your actual API key
3. Add all 12 database IDs from `VERCEL_ENV_VARIABLES.txt`
