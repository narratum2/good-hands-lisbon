## Why This Service Matters

Lisbon's coastal locations are stunning. Cabo da Roca, Cascais, Sintra—these places are Instagram gold. Professional photographers charge €300-800 for shoots here.

But photos only look professional if the people in them look professional. That requires camera-ready makeup and coastal-proof hair styling.

This service fills a clear gap: **People hiring photographers for coastal shoots need professional beauty services that work on-location.**

Good Hands is perfectly positioned to offer this because:
1. We already vet beauty professionals
2. We already coordinate bookings
3. We understand Lisbon's geography
4. We have the concierge infrastructure
5. We can coordinate with photographers

This isn't a stretch—it's a natural extension of what we already do.
