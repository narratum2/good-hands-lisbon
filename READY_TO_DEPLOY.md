## ðŸ’¡ IMPORTANT NOTES

### 1. Response Time Commitment

You've now committed to **24-hour response time**. This means:
- âœ… Check requests daily (minimum once per day)
- âœ… Have system to curate 2-3 matches
- âœ… Send personalized match emails
- âœ… Weekend/holiday coverage plan

### 2. Email Templates CRITICAL

The documented email templates MUST be implemented:
- Request confirmation (auto-send immediately)
- Match delivery (manual/semi-auto within 24 hours)

Without these, users will be confused.

### 3. Internal Process

You need:
- Dashboard to view requests
- Process to research and match professionals
- Template for sending match options
- System to track if 24-hour SLA met
